# Biomedical Text Summarization using BioBERT and BIRCH

A pipeline for summarizing biomedical texts using BioBERT and BIRCH clustering. Input (ex, a biomedical article) is preprocessed, embeddings from BioBERT are obtained, clustered, and then the final summary is selected using a sentence selection strategy.
Model performs better than the baselines compared with.
